#16.	Add 1 as the last digit in your seed, example if your group number is 106 your seed should be set as 1061 and repeat 12-15.
# Have you answers changed? (Non mandatory for part-time students!)



#17.	In your opinion how would your answers in points 12-15 change, if instead of using 95 percent (CI) you use a 90 or 99 percent (CI)?



#18.	Many times in Data Analysis we need to generate new variables from the existing dataset as well as transform the existing ones.
# Create a new variable which takes on the number of times each date (“date” variable) is found in the dataset. Call this variable
# times_date. What type of variable is this? Do the following transformations:
# normalization (times_date-min(times_date)/max(times_date)-min(times_date)), standardization (times_date-mean(times_date)/sd(times_date))
# and logarithmic (log(times_date)). What can you say about these transformations?
